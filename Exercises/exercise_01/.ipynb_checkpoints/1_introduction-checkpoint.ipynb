We use your matriculation number and send an email with the login details to the mail account associated. When in doubt, login into tum-online and check your mails there. You will get an id which we need in the next step. If you are an external student, please contact us directly via the mailing list so that we can issue you a personal account since the automatic registration uses the TUM native matriculation numbers for registration.\n",
    "2. Log into [our submission page](https://i2dl.vc.in.tum.de/) with your account details and upload the zip file.\n",
    "3. Your submission will be evaluated by our system and you will get feedback about the current progress and performance of it. You will get an email with your score as well as a message if you have surpassed the threshold.\n",
    "4. Within the working period, you can submit as many solutions as you want to get the best possible score. Once the submission closes up, you can no longer submit any newer models for graded evaluation."
