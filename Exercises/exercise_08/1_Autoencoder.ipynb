    "One application of autoencoders is unsupervised pretraining with unlabeled data and then finetuning the encoder with labeled data. This can increase our performance if there is only little labeled data but a lot of unlabeled data available.\n",

The `encoder`'s task is to extract meaningful information out of our input so that the classifier can make a proper decision. Right now however, both networks will be consisting of linear layers coupled with auxiliary ones and therefore won't be too different in their design. This split-up will be relevant later, e.g., by using convolutional layers which are introduced in the lecture. We are going to set up the `encoder` now. \n",
